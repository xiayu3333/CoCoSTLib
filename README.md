# Getting started
Add this folder to Matlab path, run **add2browser**, and 
this library should appear in the library browser.
If not, refresh in library browser.

# STL
Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a formalism to express predicates on the values of signals. 
STL formulas consist of atomic predicates connected by Boolean and temporal operators.
